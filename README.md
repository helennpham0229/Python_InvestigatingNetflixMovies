# Python_InvestigatingNetflixMovies

In this project, we will perform exploratory data analysis on the netflix_data.csv data to understand more about movies from the 1990s decade.

•	What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s?

•	Count the number of short (less than 90 minutes) action movies released in the 1990s
